on this phases

Phase I
In-Memory Python Console App
Python, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
Phase II
Full-Stack Web Application
Next.js, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB
Phase III
AI-Powered Todo Chatbot
OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK
Phase IV
Local Kubernetes Deployment
Docker, Minikube, Helm, kubectl-ai, kagent
Phase V
Advanced Cloud Deployment
Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean DOKS

and objectives

These form the foundation—quick to build, essential for any MVP:
Add Task – Create new todo items
Delete Task – Remove tasks from the list
Update Task – Modify existing task details
View Task List – Display all tasks
Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status


Implement all 5 Basic Level features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete)
Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure


Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application

 transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage

Requirements
Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application
Create RESTful API endpoints
Build responsive frontend interface
Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database
Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth


Phase III: Todo AI Chatbot

Create an AI-powered chatbot interface for managing todos through natural language using MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Implement conversational interface for all Basic Level features
Use OpenAI Agents SDK for AI logic
Build MCP server with Official MCP SDK that exposes task operations as tools
Stateless chat endpoint that persists conversation state to database
AI agents use MCP tools to manage tasks. The MCP tools will also be stateless and will store state in the database. 

Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, Kagent, Docker Desktop, and Gordon)
